Due to the effects of stochastic nonlinearities and parameter uncertainties, a new augmentation approach is pro-posed by which the multi-rate sampled-data system under consideration is transformed into the single-rate system. In order to eliminate the effect of the colored measurement noises, a measurement model with uncorrected noises is established. Based on the measurement model established, a set of local event-triggered filters is constructed and the upper bounds of the local filtering error covariances at each sam-pling instant are obtained. By using the Lagrange multiplier method, the local filter parameters are de-signed such that the upper bound obtained is minimum. For the local state estimates, a new fusion esti-mation scheme is proposed with the help of covariance intersection (CI) method and the consistency of the proposed CI-based fusion estimation scheme is shown. Finally, an illustrative example is presented to verify the effectiveness of the fusion estimation scheme proposed.},

@article{Hyberts2013,
	abstract = {It is well established that non-uniform sampling (NUS) allows acquisition of multi-dimensional NMR spec- tra at a resolution that cannot be obtained with traditional uniform acquisition through the indirect dimensions. How- ever, the impact of NUS on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and sensitivity are less well documented. SNR and sensi- tivity are essential aspects of NMR experiments as they define the quality and extent of data that can be obtained. This is particularly important for spectroscopy with low concentration samples of biological macromolecules. There are different ways of defining the SNR depending on how to measure the noise, and the distinction between SNR and sensitivity is often not clear. While there are defined proce- dures for measuring sensitivity with high concentration NMR standards, such as sucrose, there is no clear or gener- ally accepted definition of sensitivity when comparing dif- ferent acquisition and processing methods for spectra of biological macromolecules with many weak signals close to the level of noise. Here we propose tools for estimating the SNRand sensitivity ofNUSspectra with respect to sampling schedule and reconstruction method.Wecompare uniformly acquired spectra withNUSspectra obtained in the same total measuring time. The time saving obtained when only 1/k of the Nyquist grid points are sampled is used to measure k-fold more scans per increment.We show that judiciously chosen NUS schedules together with suitable reconstruction meth- ods can yield a significant increase of the SNR within the same total measurement time. Furthermore, we propose to define the sensitivity as the probability to detect weak peaks and show that time-equivalent NUS can considerably increase this detection sensitivity. The sensitivity gain increases with the number of NUS indirect dimensions. Thus, well-chosen NUS schedules and reconstruction methods can significantly increase the information content of multidimensional NMR spectra of challenging biological macromolecules.},

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the dynamic Markov jump filters for discrete-time system with random delays in the observations. It is assumed that the delay process is modeled as a finite state Markov chain. To overcome the difficulty of estimation caused by the random delays, the single random delayed measurement system is firstly rewritten as the multiplicative noise constant-delay system. Then, by applying the measurement reorganization approach, the system is further transformed into the delay-free one with Markov jump parameters. Finally, the estimator is derived by using the standard Markov jump filter theories. It is interesting to show that the presented filter for the system with random jump delays can be designed by performing two sets of standard Riccati equations with the same dimension as that of the original system. A simulation example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed result. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

An event-triggered communication scheme is utilized to save the constrained computation resource and network bandwidth while preserving the desired performance. The measure-ments on each node are transmitted to the estimators only when a certain triggering condition is sat-isfied. Moreover, in order to improve the reliability of data transmission services, we exploit redundant communication channels during the transmission process. The purpose of this paper is to design a set of time-varying state estimators such that the dynamics of the state estimation error satisfies the average H ∞ performance constraints. The specific gains of the estimator can be obtained by calculating a series of recursive linear matrix inequalities (RLMIs).

@article{Challa2003,
	abstract = {Target tracking using delayed, out-of-sequence measurements is a problem of growing importance due to an increased reliance on networked sensors interconnected via complex communication network architectures. In such systems, it is often the case that measurements are received out-of-time-order at the fusion center. This paper presents a Bayesian solution to this problem and provides approximate, implementable algorithms for both cluttered and non-cluttered scenarios involving single and multiple time-delayed measurements. Such an approach leads to a solution involving the joint probability density of current and past target states. In contrast, existing solutions in the literature modify the sensor measurement equation to account for the time delay and ex-plicitly deal with the resulting correlations that arise in the process noise and current target state. In the Bayesian solution proposed in this paper, such cross correlations are treated implicitly. Under linear Gaussian assumptions, the Bayesian solution reduces to an augmented state Kalman filter (AS-KF) for scenarios devoid of clutter and an augmented state probabilistic data association filter (AS-PDA) for scenarios involving clutter. Computationally efficient versions of AS-KF and AS-PDA are considered in this paper. Simulations are presented to evaluate the performance of these solutions.},

If such a bound is not sa- tisfied the resulting spectrum is said to be aliased. Nonuniform sampling is not bound by the sampling theorem, although it is influenced by some practical limitations. This work investigates some of these limitations and proposes a procedure to check if a signal with unknown spectrum is aliased after uniform sampling. Such procedure is evaluated by means of simulation and is discussed in this work in the context of an implementation in digital signal processors with memory restrictions. Results show that alias detection is possible, with a high rate of success, if sample size and signal to noise ratio requirements are met},

We address this problem starting from the discrete Kalman filtering formulation, and modeling the arrival of the observation as a random process. We study the statistical convergence properties of the estimation error covariance, showing the existence of a critical value for the arrival rate of the observations, beyond which a transition to an unbounded state error covariance occurs.

Send-on-delta concept is the signal-dependenttemporal sampling scheme, where the sampling is triggered if the signal deviates by deltadefined as the significant change of its value. It is an attractive scheme for wireless sensornetworking due to effective energy consumption. The quantitative evaluations of send-on-delta scheme for a general type continuous-time bandlimited signal are presented in thepaper. The bounds on the mean traffic of reports for a given signal, and assumed samplingresolution, are evaluated. Furthermore, the send-on-delta effectiveness, defined as thereduction of the mean rate of reports in comparison to the periodic sampling for a givenresolution, is derived. It is shown that the lower bound of the send-on-delta effectiveness(i.e. the guaranteed reduction) is independent of the sampling resolution, and constitutes thebuilt-in feature of the input signal. The calculation of the effectiveness for standard signals,that model the state evolution of dynamic environment in time, is exemplified. Finally, theexample of send-on-delta programming is shown.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) technology have led to the development of small, low-cost, and low-power sensors. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) consist of large populations of wirelessly connected nodes, capable of computation, communication, and sensing. In such networks, data from each sensor is agglomerated using data fusion to form a single meaningful result, which makes time synchronization between sensors highly desirable. Hence, time synchronization is a crucial component of WSNs, but achieving synchronization in WSNs, which combine stringent precision requirements with severe resource constraints, is particularly challenging. Instead of time synchronization between just the sender and receiver or within a local group of sensor nodes, some applications require the sensor nodes to maintain a similar time within a certain tolerance throughout the lifetime of the network. This paper surveys and evaluates that time-diffusion synchronization protocols based on a variety of factors like precision, accuracy, cost, and complexity.},

	abstract = {The problem of estimating the state of a dynamical system based on limited measurements arises in many applications. For the case of a linear system with known dynamics and Gaussian noise, the classical Kalman filter (KF) provides the optimal solution [1], [2]. However, state estimation for nonlinear systems remains a challenging problem of intense research interest. Optimal nonlinear filters [3] are often infinite dimensional and thus are difficult to implement [4]. Within a deterministic setting, nonlinear observers are available for systems of special structure [5], [6]. Except for systems of special structure, however, approximate filters are usually implemented in practice. Two main approaches are available for approximate nonlinear filtering. The first approach is based on analytically or numerically linearizing the nonlinear dynamics and measurement map and then employing the classical KF equations. For example, the extended KF (EKF) [1], [2] uses nonlinear dynamics to propagate the state estimate as well as the Jacobians of the dynamics and output maps to propagate the pseudo error covariance. The EKF is often highly effective, and documented applications cover an extraordinarily broad range of disciplines, from motor control [7] to weather forecasting [8].},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of state estimation for nonlinear systems by means of the unscented Kalman filter (UKF). Compared to the traditional extended Kalman filter, the UKF does not require the local linearization of the system equations used in the propagation stage. Important results using the UKF have been reported recently but in every case the system equations used by the filter were considered known. Not only that, such models are usually considered to be differential equations, which requires that numerical integration be performed during the propagation phase of the filter. In this paper the dynamical equations of the system are taken to be difference equations--thus avoiding numerical integration--and are built from data without prior knowledge. The identified models are subsequently implemented in the filter in order to accomplish state estimation. The paper discusses the impact of not knowing the exact equations and using data-driven models in the context of state and joint state-and-parameter estimation. The procedure is illustrated by means of examples that use simulated and measured data.},
