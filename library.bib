Due to the effects of stochastic nonlinearities and parameter uncertainties, a new augmentation approach is pro-posed by which the multi-rate sampled-data system under consideration is transformed into the single-rate system. In order to eliminate the effect of the colored measurement noises, a measurement model with uncorrected noises is established. Based on the measurement model established, a set of local event-triggered filters is constructed and the upper bounds of the local filtering error covariances at each sam-pling instant are obtained. By using the Lagrange multiplier method, the local filter parameters are de-signed such that the upper bound obtained is minimum. For the local state estimates, a new fusion esti-mation scheme is proposed with the help of covariance intersection (CI) method and the consistency of the proposed CI-based fusion estimation scheme is shown. Finally, an illustrative example is presented to verify the effectiveness of the fusion estimation scheme proposed.},

@article{Hyberts2013,
	abstract = {It is well established that non-uniform sampling (NUS) allows acquisition of multi-dimensional NMR spec- tra at a resolution that cannot be obtained with traditional uniform acquisition through the indirect dimensions. How- ever, the impact of NUS on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and sensitivity are less well documented. SNR and sensi- tivity are essential aspects of NMR experiments as they define the quality and extent of data that can be obtained. This is particularly important for spectroscopy with low concentration samples of biological macromolecules. There are different ways of defining the SNR depending on how to measure the noise, and the distinction between SNR and sensitivity is often not clear. While there are defined proce- dures for measuring sensitivity with high concentration NMR standards, such as sucrose, there is no clear or gener- ally accepted definition of sensitivity when comparing dif- ferent acquisition and processing methods for spectra of biological macromolecules with many weak signals close to the level of noise. Here we propose tools for estimating the SNRand sensitivity ofNUSspectra with respect to sampling schedule and reconstruction method.Wecompare uniformly acquired spectra withNUSspectra obtained in the same total measuring time. The time saving obtained when only 1/k of the Nyquist grid points are sampled is used to measure k-fold more scans per increment.We show that judiciously chosen NUS schedules together with suitable reconstruction meth- ods can yield a significant increase of the SNR within the same total measurement time. Furthermore, we propose to define the sensitivity as the probability to detect weak peaks and show that time-equivalent NUS can considerably increase this detection sensitivity. The sensitivity gain increases with the number of NUS indirect dimensions. Thus, well-chosen NUS schedules and reconstruction methods can significantly increase the information content of multidimensional NMR spectra of challenging biological macromolecules.},

It is assumed that the delay process is modeled as a finite state Markov chain. To overcome the difficulty of estimation caused by the random delays, the single random delayed measurement system is firstly rewritten as the multiplicative noise constant-delay system. Then, by applying the measurement reorganization approach, the system is further transformed into the delay-free one with Markov jump parameters. Finally, the estimator is derived by using the standard Markov jump filter theories. It is interesting to show that the presented filter for the system with random jump delays can be designed by performing two sets of standard Riccati equations with the same dimension as that of the original system. A simulation example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed result. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {a b s t r a c t This paper is concerned with the distributed state estimation problem for a class of time-varying sys-tems over sensor networks. An event-triggered communication scheme is utilized to save the constrained computation resource and network bandwidth while preserving the desired performance. The measure-ments on each node are transmitted to the estimators only when a certain triggering condition is sat-isfied. Moreover, in order to improve the reliability of data transmission services, we exploit redundant communication channels during the transmission process. The purpose of this paper is to design a set of time-varying state estimators such that the dynamics of the state estimation error satisfies the average H ∞ performance constraints. The specific gains of the estimator can be obtained by calculating a series of recursive linear matrix inequalities (RLMIs). Finally, a simulation example is presented to show the effectiveness of the state estimation method proposed in this paper.},

@article{Challa2003,
	abstract = {Target tracking using delayed, out-of-sequence measurements is a problem of growing importance due to an increased reliance on networked sensors interconnected via complex communication network architectures. In such systems, it is often the case that measurements are received out-of-time-order at the fusion center. This paper presents a Bayesian solution to this problem and provides approximate, implementable algorithms for both cluttered and non-cluttered scenarios involving single and multiple time-delayed measurements. Such an approach leads to a solution involving the joint probability density of current and past target states. In contrast, existing solutions in the literature modify the sensor measurement equation to account for the time delay and ex-plicitly deal with the resulting correlations that arise in the process noise and current target state. In the Bayesian solution proposed in this paper, such cross correlations are treated implicitly. Under linear Gaussian assumptions, the Bayesian solution reduces to an augmented state Kalman filter (AS-KF) for scenarios devoid of clutter and an augmented state probabilistic data association filter (AS-PDA) for scenarios involving clutter. Computationally efficient versions of AS-KF and AS-PDA are considered in this paper. Simulations are presented to evaluate the performance of these solutions.},

If such a bound is not sa- tisfied the resulting spectrum is said to be aliased. Nonuniform sampling is not bound by the sampling theorem, although it is influenced by some practical limitations. This work investigates some of these limitations and proposes a procedure to check if a signal with unknown spectrum is aliased after uniform sampling. Such procedure is evaluated by means of simulation and is discussed in this work in the context of an implementation in digital signal processors with memory restrictions. Results show that alias detection is possible, with a high rate of success, if sample size and signal to noise ratio requirements are met},

When data travel along unreliable communication channels in a large, wireless, multihop sensor network, the effect of communication delays and loss of information in the control loop cannot be neglected. We address this problem starting from the discrete Kalman filtering formulation, and modeling the arrival of the observation as a random process. We study the statistical convergence properties of the estimation error covariance, showing the existence of a critical value for the arrival rate of the observations, beyond which a transition to an unbounded state error covariance occurs. We also give upper and lower bounds on this expected state error covariance.},
