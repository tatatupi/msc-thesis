abstract = {Background: Data assimilation refers to methods for updating the state vector (initial condition) of a complex spatiotemporal model (such as a numerical weather model) by combining new observations with one or more prior forecasts. We consider the potential feasibility of this approach for making short-term (60-day) forecasts of the growth and spread of a malignant brain cancer (glioblastoma multiforme) in individual patient cases, where the observations are synthetic magnetic resonance images of a hypothetical tumor. Results: We apply a modern state estimation algorithm (the Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter), previously developed for numerical weather prediction, to two different mathematical models of glioblastoma, taking into account likely errors in model parameters and measurement uncertainties in magnetic resonance imaging. The filter can accurately shadow the growth of a representative synthetic tumor for 360 days (six 60-day forecast/ update cycles) in the presence of a moderate degree of systematic model error and measurement noise. Conclusions: The mathematical methodology described here may prove useful for other modeling efforts in biology and oncology. An accurate forecast system for glioblastoma may prove useful in clinical settings for treatment planning and patient counseling.},

The measurements from different sensors may undergo the missing phe-nomena, which are characterized by a set of mutually independent Bernoulli random variables and the missing probabilities could be uncertain. In addition, the event-triggered transmission mechanism is in-troduced to reduce the network communication burden, where the current measurement is transmitted to the remote filter only when it changes greatly compared with the previous one. The aim of this paper is to design a time-varying filter such that, in the presence of the multiple missing measurements, event-triggered transmission mechanism and stochastic nonlinearities, an upper bound of the filtering error covariance is obtained and then minimized by properly designing the filter gain. The explicit form of the filter gain is given in terms of the solutions to two recursive matrix equations. It is shown that the devel-oped filtering scheme is of a recursive form applicable for the online computations. Finally, we provide two illustrative examples to demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of the developed event-triggered filtering scheme.},

abstract = {In asynchronous multi-sensor fusion, it is hard to guarantee that all sensors work at the single sam-pling rate, especially in the distributive and heterogeneous case. Meanwhile, the time-varying sensor bias driven by unknown inputs (UIs) are likely to occur in complex environments when conducting the sensor registration. In this paper, a two-stage fusion scheme is proposed to estimate the state, the UI and the UI-driven bias for asynchronous multi-sensor fusion. By establishing the dynamic system model at each scale and deriving its corresponding equivalent UI-decoupled bias dynamic model, the proposed scheme is implemented in two stages. At the first stage, each sensor collects its own measurements and gen-erates the local optimal estimates of the state and the bias which are later used to compute the local estimate of the UI via the least squares method. At the second stage, local estimates of the state and the UI are distributively fused via network consensus to obtain the consensus state and UI estimates which are fed back to refine the local bias estimate. Local estimators are designed via the orthogonal projection principle and the least squares method, and the fusion estimators are designed via the average consen-sus fusion rule weighted by matrices. Simulation experiments are given to show the effectiveness of the developed method.},

abstract = {We consider an acquisition system where a con- tinuous, band-limited image is reconstructed from a set of irregularly distributed, noisy samples. An optimal estimator can be obtained by exploiting Least Squares (LS), but it is not practical to compute when the data size is large. A simpler, widely used estimate can be obtained by properly rounding off the pointing information, but it is suboptimal and is affected by a bias which may be large and thus limits its applicability. To solve this problem, we develop a mathematical model for the acquisition system which accounts for the pointing information round off. Based on the model, we derive a novel optimal estimate, which has a manageable computational complexity and is largely immune from the bias, making it a better option than the suboptimal one. Moreover, the model opens a new, fruitful point of view on the estimation performance analysis. Finally, we consider the application of the novel estimate to the data of the Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer (PACS) instrument. In this context, we discuss several implementation aspects and investigate the performance by using both true and simulated data},

abstract = {Target tracking using delayed, out-of-sequence measurements is a problem of growing importance due to an increased reliance on networked sensors interconnected via complex communication network architectures. In such systems, it is often the case that measurements are received out-of-time-order at the fusion center. This paper presents a Bayesian solution to this problem and provides approximate, implementable algorithms for both cluttered and non-cluttered scenarios involving single and multiple time-delayed measurements. Such an approach leads to a solution involving the joint probability density of current and past target states. In contrast, existing solutions in the literature modify the sensor measurement equation to account for the time delay and ex-plicitly deal with the resulting correlations that arise in the process noise and current target state. In the Bayesian solution proposed in this paper, such cross correlations are treated implicitly. Under linear Gaussian assumptions, the Bayesian solution reduces to an augmented state Kalman filter (AS-KF) for scenarios devoid of clutter and an augmented state probabilistic data association filter (AS-PDA) for scenarios involving clutter. Computationally efficient versions of AS-KF and AS-PDA are considered in this paper. Simulations are presented to evaluate the performance of these solutions.},

Such a system models a network of a large number of sensors that are not synchronized with one another, where the waiting time between two measurements is modelled by an exponential random vari-able. We formulate a Kalman Filter-based state estimation algorithm. The sequence of estimation error covariance matrices is not deterministic as for the ordinary Kalman Filter, but is a stochastic process itself: it is a homogeneous Markov process. In the one-dimensional case we compute a complete statistical description of this process: such a description depends on the Poisson sampling rate (which is proportional to the number of sensors on a network) and on the dynamics of the continuous-time system represented by the state equation. Finally, we have found a lower bound on the sam-pling rate that makes it possible to keep the estimation error variance below a given threshold with an arbitrary probability.},

For networked systems, event-based transmission scheme is capable of improving the efficiency in resource utilization and prolonging the lifetime of the network components compared with the widely adopted periodic transmission scheme. As such, it would be interesting to 1) examining how the event-triggering mechanisms affect the control or filtering performance for networked systems, and 2) developing some suitable approaches for the controller and filter design problems. In this paper, a bibliographical review is presented on event-based control and filtering problems for various networked systems. First, the event-driven communication scheme is introduced in detail according to its engineering background, characteristic, and representative research frameworks. Then, different event-based control and filtering (or state estimation) problems are categorized and then discussed. Finally, we conclude the paper by outlining future research challenges for event-based networked systems.},

abstract = {In a standard setup of conventional state estimation problems, the output signal of a dynamical system is sampled at every regular time interval. This paper addresses an estimation problem under event-triggered sampling: an irregular sampling rule in which the output signal is sampled only when a specified event occurs. In particular, this paper focuses on the Lebesgue sampling, which is a type of event-triggered sampling such that the output signal is sampled only when it crosses specific thresholds. In the proposed estimation method, not only information in the sampled points but also that in the inter-sample intervals are utilized to improve the estimation accuracy efficiently. The particle filter is applied to the estimation since the inter-sample information makes the distribution of the estimates non-Gaussian. Furthermore, the proposed estimator is combined with a linear-quadratic-regulator (LQR) type state-feedback controller. The derived control law can be an effective approach to an event-triggered control problem in which the Lebesgue-sampled output is utilized. The effectiveness of both of estimation and control methods is examined through numerical examples.},

abstract = {The optimal filter for continuous, linear, stochastic, time-varying systems described by the Itocirc-Volterra equations with discontinuous measure is derived. With an appropriately selected measure, the result is applicable to a wide range of observation processes, including the hybrid case of observations formed by an arbitrary combination of continuous and discrete measurements, which may be sampled with a priori unknown, changing, and, possibly, random rates and delays. The simultaneous presence of continuous and sampled measurements causes impulsive discontinuity in the inputs of the optimal filter equations, which leads to a discontinuous change in state estimates every time a sampled measurement becomes available. Using the theory of vibrosolutions, the explicit and unique expressions for the jumps in state estimates and estimation error covariance are derived. Several examples illustrate the procedure of modeling hybrid measurement systems by selecting an appropriate discontinuous measure. We further show that the Itocirc-Volterra model and the main result of the paper can be specialized to several important cases, including state space systems, for which we recover several known state estimation results, and derive a novel optimal filter for continuous LTV systems with an arbitrary combination of continuous and delayed sampled measurements. This optimal filter updates the state estimates for incoming measurements as soon as they become available and does not require prior knowledge of sampling instants and delays, which makes it applicable when deterministic and random changes in sampling and delays are present. Several computational examples demonstrate the implementation of the developed filter and compare its performance to the traditional alternatives using Monte-Carlo simulations},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t This work deals with state estimation in the presence of delayed and infrequent measurements. While most measurements (referred to as secondary measurements) are available frequently and instanta-neously, there might be a delay associated with acquiring other measurements (primary measurements) due to long analysis times involved. The primary measurements are usually sampled at irregular inter-vals and the exact delay is also unknown. The traditional fixed-lag smoothing algorithm, which has been applied for a variety of chemical processes systems, can be computationally inefficient for such situations and alternate methods to handle delays are necessary. In this paper, we analyze several existing methods to incorporate measurement delays and reinterpret their results under a common unified framework (for Extended Kalman Filter). Extensions to handle time-varying and uncertain delays, as well as out of sequence measurement arrival are also presented. Simulation studies on a linear distillation column and a nonlinear polymerization reactor are used to compare the performance of these methods based on RMSE values and computation times. A large scale nonlinear reactive distillation column example is also used to illustrate the practicality of the suggested method.},

abstract = {Automated driving applications require an environment perception that is reliable and fast. Multi-sensor fusion is a suitable means to combine the advantages of different measurement principles. However, this may lead to out-of-sequence measurements, i.e., asynchronous measurements where the original order of the measurements is lost. High-performance out-of-sequence algorithms are therefore needed that do not depend on the order of the measurements. In addition, existence probabilities can increase the reliability of the fusion system especially in safety critical applications. This paper presents a novel approach to handle out-of-sequence measurements not only in state estimation, but also in existence estimation. The method is shown to result in equal or less computational costs than state-of-the-art methods. The proposed algorithm is evaluated with real world data from crash tests.},

abstract = {When sensor data from multiple platforms is collected and fused in centralized manner, sensor measurements can arrive out-of-sequence at the central processor due to varying pre-processing times at the platforms and uncertain data transmission delays in communication networks. As a result, classical filters for orderly measurements, such as Kalman filter, cannot be used directly. There are three classes of OOSM (out-of-sequence measurements), respectively called single-lag OOSM, multiple-lag OOSM, and mixed-lag OOSM. For the first two classes of OOSM, [3-6] have studied some optimal or suboptimal filters. This paper develops a recursive filter algorithm called UOOSMF (Unified Out-of-sequence Measurements Filter), which can sequentially process the OOSM in order of the time of arrival and is suboptimal in the linear MMSE sense under one acceptable approximation. The filter is accommodated with all the above three classes of OOSM. With the same measurements, the estimation accuracy of the UOOSMF is almost the same as standard Kalman filter for orderly measurements, and its computations and memory requirements are low. Numerical example proves the above conclusions.},

abstract = {In engineering practice, the sampling interval for a sampled-data system often fluctuates around a nominal/ideal value based on certain probability distributions that can be specified a priori through statistical tests. In this paper, a fundamental stabilization problem is investigated for a class of sampled-data systems under noisy sampling interval. The stochastic sampled-data control system under consideration is first converted into a discrete-time system whose system matrix is represented as an equivalent yet tractable form via the matrix exponential computation. Then, by introducing a Vandermonde matrix, the mathematical expectation of the quadratic form of the system matrix is computed. By recurring to the Kronecker product operation, the sampled-data stabilization controller is designed such that the closed-loop system is stochastically stable in the presence of noisy sampling interval. Subsequently, a special case is considered where the sampling interval obeys the continuous uniform distribution and the corresponding stabilization controller is designed. Finally, a numerical simulation example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design approach.},

The choice of ”adaptive weights” can be seen as a simple but very efficient method of preconditioning. Further substantial acceleration is achieved by utilizing the Toeplitz- type structure of the system matrix.

In multisensor tracking systems that operate in a centralized manner, there are usually different time delays in transmitting the scans or frames from the various sensors to the center. This can lead to situations where measurements from the same target arrive out of sequence. Such "out-of-sequence" measurement (OOSM) arrivals can occur even in the absence of scan/frame communication time delays. The resulting "negative-time measurement update" problem, which is quite common in real multisensor systems, was solved previously only approximately in the literature. The exact state update equation for such a problem is presented.

Hence, information is always meaningful (in a sense to be explicated) rather than its meaning would show up as a later specification of information within social systems only. This perspective taken has two immediate consequences: (1) We follow the GDI as defined by Floridi, though we modify it somehow as to the aspect of truthfulness. (2) We can conceptually solve Capurro's trilemma. Hence, what we actually do is to follow the strict (i.e. optimistic) line of UTI in the sense of Hofkirchner's.

abstract = {Non-uniform sampling comes natural in many applications, due to for example imperfect sensors, mismatched clocks or event-triggered phenomena. Examples can be found in automotive industry and data communication as well as medicine and astronomy. Yet, the literature on statistical signal processing to a large extent focuses on algorithms and analysis for uniformly, or regularly, sampled data. This work focuses on Fourier analysis, system identification and decimation of non-uniformly sampled data. In non-uniform sampling (NUS), signal amplitude and time stamps are de- livered in pairs. Several methods to compute an approximate Fourier transform (AFT) have appeared in literature, and their posterior properties in terms of alias suppression and leakage have been addressed. In this thesis, the sampling times are assumed to be generated by a stochastic process, and the main idea is to use in- formation about the stochastic sampling process to calculate a priori properties of approximate frequency transforms. These results are also used to give insight in frequency domain system identification and help with analysis of down-sampling algorithms. The main result gives the prior distribution of several AFTs expressed in terms of the true Fourier transform and variants of the characteristic function of the sampling time distribution. The result extends leakage and alias suppression with bias and variance terms due to NUS. Based on this, decimation of non- uniformly sampled signals, using continuous-time anti-alias filters, is analyzed. The decimation is based on interpolation in different domains, and interpolation in the convolution integral proves particularly useful. The same idea is also used to investigate how stochastic unmeasurable sampling jitter noise affects the result of system identification. The result is a modification of known approaches to mitigate the bias and variance increase caused by the sampling jitter noise. The bottom line is that, when non-uniform sampling is present, the approxi- mate frequency transform, identified transfer function and anti-alias filter are all biased to what is expected from classical theory on uniform sampling. This work gives tools to analyze and correct for this bias.},

abstract = {It is well established that non-uniform sampling (NUS) allows acquisition of multi-dimensional NMR spec- tra at a resolution that cannot be obtained with traditional uniform acquisition through the indirect dimensions. How- ever, the impact of NUS on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and sensitivity are less well documented. SNR and sensi- tivity are essential aspects of NMR experiments as they define the quality and extent of data that can be obtained. This is particularly important for spectroscopy with low concentration samples of biological macromolecules. There are different ways of defining the SNR depending on how to measure the noise, and the distinction between SNR and sensitivity is often not clear. While there are defined proce- dures for measuring sensitivity with high concentration NMR standards, such as sucrose, there is no clear or gener- ally accepted definition of sensitivity when comparing dif- ferent acquisition and processing methods for spectra of biological macromolecules with many weak signals close to the level of noise. Here we propose tools for estimating the SNRand sensitivity ofNUSspectra with respect to sampling schedule and reconstruction method.Wecompare uniformly acquired spectra withNUSspectra obtained in the same total measuring time. The time saving obtained when only 1/k of the Nyquist grid points are sampled is used to measure k-fold more scans per increment.We show that judiciously chosen NUS schedules together with suitable reconstruction meth- ods can yield a significant increase of the SNR within the same total measurement time. Furthermore, we propose to define the sensitivity as the probability to detect weak peaks and show that time-equivalent NUS can considerably increase this detection sensitivity. The sensitivity gain increases with the number of NUS indirect dimensions. Thus, well-chosen NUS schedules and reconstruction methods can significantly increase the information content of multidimensional NMR spectra of challenging biological macromolecules.},

abstract = {Many information rich multi-dimensional experiments in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy can benefit from a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) enhancement up to about two-fold if a decaying signal in an indirect dimension is sampled with nonconsecutive increments, termed non-uniform sampling (NUS). This work provides formal theoretical results and applications to resolve major questions on the scope of the NUS enhancement. First, we introduce the NUS Sensitivity Theorem, that any decreasing sampling density applied to any exponentially decaying signal always results in higher sensitivity (SNR per square root of measurement time) than uniform sampling (US). Several cases will illustrate this theorem, and show that even conservative applications of NUS improve sensitivity by useful amounts. Next, we turn to a serious limitation of uniform sampling: the SNR by US decreases for extending evolution times, and thus total experimental times, beyond 1.26 T2 (T2 = signal decay constant). Thus SNR and resolution cannot be simultaneously improved by extending US beyond 1.26 T2. We find that NUS can eliminate this constraint, and introduce the Matched NUS SNR Theorem: an exponential sampling density matched to the signal decay always improves the SNR with additional evolution time. Though proved for a specific case, broader classes of NUS densities also improve SNR with evolution time. Applications of these theoretical results are given for a soluble plant natural product and a solid tripeptide (u-13C,15N-MLF). These formal results clearly demonstrate the inadequacies of applying US to decaying signals in indirect nD-NMR dimensions, supporting broader adoption of NUS},

abstract = {We give an overview of recent developments in the problem of reconstructing a band-limited signal from nonuniform sampling from a numerical analysis view point. It is shown that the appropriate design of the ?nite-dimensional model plays a key role in the numerical solution of the nonuniform sampling problem. In the one approach (often proposed in the literature) the ?nite-dimensional model leads to an ill-posed problem even in very simple situations. The other approach that we consider leads to a well-posed problem that preserves important structural properties of the original in?nite-dimensional problem and gives rise to e?cient numerical algorithms. Furthermore, a fast multilevel algorithm is presented that can reconstruct signals of unknown bandwidth from noisy nonuniformly spaced samples. We also discuss the design of e?cient regularization methods for ill-conditioned reconstruction problems. Numerical examples from spectroscopy and exploration geophysics demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods},

abstract = {The sampling theorem determines a lower bound for the sampling fre- quency necessary for the perfect representation of a continuous signal by a countable set of uniformly spaced time samples. If such a bound is not sa- tisfied the resulting spectrum is said to be aliased. Nonuniform sampling is not bound by the sampling theorem, although it is influenced by some practical limitations. This work investigates some of these limitations and proposes a procedure to check if a signal with unknown spectrum is aliased after uniform sampling. Such procedure is evaluated by means of simulation and is discussed in this work in the context of an implementation in digital signal processors with memory restrictions. Results show that alias detection is possible, with a high rate of success, if sample size and signal to noise ratio requirements are met},

In dynamic system with noise, after taking measurements, it often requires some time until that is available in a filter. A filter not considering this time delay cannot be used since a current measurement is related with a past state. These delayed measurements problem is solved with augmented state Kalman filter, and uncertainty of the delayed time is also resolved based on the probability distribution of the delay.

abstract = {In many chemical processes, variables which indicate product quality are infrequently and irregularly sampled. Often, the inter- sample behavior of these quality variables can be inferred from manipulated variables and other process variables which are measured frequently. When the quality variables are irregularly sampled, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of the model parameters can be performed using the expectation maximization (EM) approach. A state-space model identification procedure based on the EM algorithm yields a Kalman filter-based prediction–correction mechanism which can be used for optimal prediction of the quality variables. In this paper, we describe such a state-space model identification and estimation method and present the results of its application on simulation, laboratory-scale and industrial case studies. r 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The approach is based on a modification of the Kalman filter with the negative-time measurement update strategy, avoiding running back the full standard Kalman filter, the use of full augmented order models or the use of reorganisation techniques, leading to a lower implementation cost algorithm. The update equations are run every time a new measurement is available, independently of the time when it was taken. The approach is useful for networked control systems, systems with long delays and scarce measurements and for out-of-sequence measurements},

abstract = {State estimation for a system with irregular rate and delayed measurements is studied using fusion Kalman filter. Lab data in process plants is usually more accurate compared to other measurements. However, it is often slow rate and subject to variable delay and irregularity in sampling time. Fast rate state estimation can be conducted using fast rate measurement, while the slow rate lab data can be used to improve the accuracy of estimation whenever it is available. For this purpose, two Kalman filters are used to estimate the states based on each type of measurement. The estimates are fused in the next step by considering the correlation between them. An iterative algorithm to obtain the cross-covariance matrix between the estimation errors of the two Kalman filters is presented and employed in the fusion process. The improvement on the accuracy of estimation and comparison with other optimal fusion state estimation techniques are discussed through a simulation example, a pilot-scale experiment and an industrial case study.},
